# Heaven's gate
# Author: Aditya Baronia
# Idea: Injecting a shellcode in a 32-bit process and from there travel through heavens gate to execute 64-bit instruction. When executing 64-bit 
instruction find the ntdll.dll from gs:[0x60] the ldr table. Go through the ntdll's export directory and call the required function.
